# Conributing to RPi-Device Adapters

First off, thank you very much for wanting to contribute to the
RPi-DeviceAdapters project!

Now, you might be wondering how you can contribute. In fact, a
contribution does not have to be thousands of lines of C++ code; it
could be as small as a simple fix to a typo in the documentation.

Most contributions will fall into these categories:

- Bug reports and feature requests
- Documentation changes
- Code contributions

## Bug reports and feature requests

Both bug reports and feature requests can be made on the [issue
tracker](https://github.com/kmdouglass/RPi-DeviceAdapters/issues). When
reporting a bug please

- list a minimal set of steps to reproduce the bug;
- if using the app, please provide the version number by running
  `mm.py --version`.

## Documentation changes

Changes to the documentation may be made either by pull request or by
opening an issue in the [issue
tracker](https://github.com/kmdouglass/RPi-DeviceAdapters/issues). The
issue tracker is preferred for large changes so that they may be
discussed.

## Code contributions

The code base consists of

- C/C++ device adapters
- Python utility scripts
- Bash scripts, m4 templates, and configuration files

For C/C++ code, I prefer indents of two spaces. For Python, I use the
`Black`(https://github.com/ambv/black) formatter. I encourage you to
follow the existing code style. However, since this is a small
project, I will not demand strict adherence to any particular style.

## Questions

If you have any questions, feel free to post them in the [issue
tracker](https://github.com/kmdouglass/RPi-DeviceAdapters/issues) or
send me an e-mail at kyle.m.douglass AT gmail.com.

Happy tinkering!
